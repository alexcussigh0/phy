# Multiple Sequence Alignment

## intro: 
All phylogenetic methods require a set of homologous characters thus the first step is to infer which nucleotides/codons/aminocid residues are homologous to each other, so that differences among these nucleotides result only from changes that confey descent information. This process is called  "multiple sequence alignment" and is often followed by a furhter step of detect and exclude alignment regions whose homology may be questionable.


In this tutorial, we will use the most popular tools for multiple sequence alignment of coding and non coding sequences:
